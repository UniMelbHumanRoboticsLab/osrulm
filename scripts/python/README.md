# ISB UL Model
Python package to represent an UL model compatible with ISB representation and the [OpenSIM MoBL-ARMS model](https://simtk.org/projects/upexdyn).

The package contains classes and functions to define an UL model using the robotics toolbox representation, manipulate the model, define deweighting algorithms and interface functions to load, write and analyse OpenSIM file formats of the OpenSIM MoBl ARMS model.


## Dependencies

 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
 - the [Robotics toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python)
 - and [Spatial math toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/spatialmath-python)
