# Upper-Limb Musculoskeletal  Study: Integrating External-Forces for In-Depth Analysis of Robotic Assistance and Motor Learning

By Sivaprasad Kunnath, Kun Chu

---------------------------------------------------
## Introduction

Robotic (haptic) devices allow to investigate human motor learning by applying controlled force fields to human subjects and observing their reaction. In this context, it is of interest to have an in-depth view of the subject reaction, down to the muscle level. The field of human biomechanics offers insights into methods for measuring these reaction forces when subjected to external forces. Tools merging external force measure, muscle activation (EMG signals) and kinetic information are frequently used in gait analysis but are still lacking for Upper Limb (UL) biomechanics.
 
The objective of this project is thus to integrate external forces as applied by a robotic device into a UL musculoskeletal model. The simulation pipeline allows to investigate external force fields or robotic assistance on the subjectâ€™s muscle patterns and provide an estimation of the active muscle fibre forces by giving observed kinematic file and force file as input.
